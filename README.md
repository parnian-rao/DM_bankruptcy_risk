The purpose of this project is to look at the historical information of the S&P 500 companies and build models to predict profitability(classification) and bankruptcy risk(regression) given the required information. I used a mix of clustering techniques to explore the data and build models that can help predict profitability and detect companies that might have bankruptcy risk. I used Smote to generate minority class data for the regression problem.
